## 📈 Performance Evaluation

Let's visualize the accuracy scores of our models:

| Model      | Accuracy | Loss    |
|------------|----------|---------|
| CNN        | 90%      | 0.326   |
| VGG16      | 82.5%    | 0.154   |
| ResNet50   | 87.5%    | 0.987   |


## 🚀 Conclusion

1. **CNN Model**: With an accuracy of 90% and a low loss of 0.326, it's the clear winner in color detection.
2. **VGG16 Model**: While respectable at 82.5% accuracy, it falls short compared to the CNN model.
3. **ResNet50 Model**: Despite its 87.5% accuracy, its higher loss indicates potential overfitting.

In conclusion, the CNN model emerges as the champion in accurately detecting colors from images.
