## **Cotton Disease Classification using DL**

### 🎯 **Goal**

The objective of this project is to classify images of Cotton Leaves into 6 categories: Aphids, Army Worms, Bacterial Blight, Powdery Mildew, Target Spot and Healthy.

### 🧵 **Dataset**

The dataset consists of 6 subdirectories dealing with 5 diseases (Aphids, Army Worms, Bacterial Blight, Powdery Mildew, Target Spot) and Healthy set: each set has approximately 520 images totalling to 3118 images.

### 🧾 **Description**

The project deals with multiclass classification, classifying images into 6 categories: Aphids, Army Worms, Bacterial Blight, Powdery Mildew, Target Spot and Healthy.

### 🧮 **What I had done!**

To achieve our goals, the following steps were implemented:

- Images were loaded using keras.utils and normalized to the range 0 to 1.

- Turned Labels into probability distributions.

- Images were resized to a fixed size of 224x224 pixels.

- Custom and pre-trained models were used for this task.

### 🚀 **Models Implemented**

models used:

- ResNet-50
- Xception
- VGG16
- CNN
