## **AI GENERATED FRUITS AND REAL FRUITS CLASSIFICATION USING IMAGE PROCESSING**

### 🎯 **Goal**
The aim of this project is to identify and differentiate between images of real fruits and AI generated fruits using Image Processing methods.

### 🧾 **Description**
The project aims to classify a dataset consisting of images of apples (red/green) photographed from different angles into AI generated images or real images, irrespective of the type/color of apple. To achieve this, images need to be preprocessed and then trained on various models (at least 3), after which predictions are made for some input image. Finally, accuracy of models is compared to provide the best output.

### 🧮 **What I have done!**
As per the problem statement, the project aims to classify whether an image is real or generated by AI. The dataset consists of 302 images in total, which have all been used to achieve this purpose.<br>
After loading the dataset, extracting its features, resizing, reshaping and preprocessing it, we trained our machine learning and deep learning models and calculated their accuracy and cross verified it by prediction.<br>
Following are the models we used :
* Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) (All the three kernel viz., linear, poly and RBF)
* CNN (VGG16)
* CNN (ResNet) <br>
The accuracy percentage of our models was very satisfying (an approximate accuracy of 90 to 100% for each model) and the predictions were accurate.


### 🚀 **Models Implemented**

### 📢 **Conclusion**
After evaluating the models, they have all been observed to provide pretty much the same accuracy, with all of them outputting the correct prediction. Both the CNN models have been trained to give 100% accuracy and the SVM model also provides answers that are 100% accurate. The aim has thus been achieved.
