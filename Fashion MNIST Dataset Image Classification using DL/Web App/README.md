## Fashion MNIST Image Classification Web App

### Goal 🎯
The goal of this project is to create a web application that allows users to classify images of fashion items using a machine learning model trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset. Users can upload an image, and the application will predict the class label of the item in the image.

### Model used for the Web App 🧮
The backend of the web app utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is capable of classifying images into 10 different categories of fashion items, including T-shirts, trousers, dresses, coats, etc.

### Gradio for User Interface 🖥️
The user interface of the web app is created using Gradio, a library for creating customizable interfaces for machine learning models. Gradio simplifies the process of deploying machine learning models by providing an easy-to-use interface that allows users to interact with the model through a web browser.
