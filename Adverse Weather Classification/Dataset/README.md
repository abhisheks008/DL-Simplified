Time and again unfortunate accidents due to inclement weather conditions across the globe have surfaced. Plane crash , Ship collision, train derailment and car accidents are some of the tragic incidents that have been a part of the headlines in recent times. This grave problem of safety and security in adverse conditions has drawn the attention of the society and numerous studies have been done in past to expose the vulnerability of functioning of transportation services due to weather conditions.
With the advancement in technology and emergence of a new field, intelligent transportation, automated determination of weather condition has become more relevant. Present systems either rely on series of expensive sensors or human assistance to identify the weather conditions. Researchers have channeled their research in a direction where computer vision techniques have been used to classify the weather condition using a single image.
The task of assessing the weather condition from a single image is a straightforward and easy task for humans. Nevertheless, this task has a higher difficulty level for an autonomous system and designing a decent classifier of weather that receives single images as an input would represent an important achievement.
This data has been collected from internet and the images of interest containing Creative Commons license retrieved from Flickr, Unsplash and Pexels have been used. Different images are subject to different types of licenses.
The dataset features 5 different classes of weather collected from the above said different sources, however it's real life data so any system for weather classification must be able to handle this sort of images. The dataset contains about 1500 labelled images including the validation images. Images are not of fixed dimensions and the photos are of different sizes. Each image has only one weather category and are saved in separate folder as of the labelled class.
Each image have been rated for the weather condition on a scale of 0 to 4:

0 - Cloudy
1 - foggy
2 - rainy
3 - Shine
4 - Sunrise.
