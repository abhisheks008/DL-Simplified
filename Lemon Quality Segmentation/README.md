Approach for this Project :

**Image segmentation**

is a crucial task in computer vision that involves identifying and classifying different regions or objects within an image. In this project, I will explore three different approaches for image segmentation using deep learning models: **Simple_CNN**, **AlexNet**, and **VGG**.

 **Simple_CNN** 
 
**To begin,** I will leverage the **Simple_CNN** architecture, which is a lightweight convolutional neural network suitable for small-scale image segmentation tasks. With its simplicity, this model can quickly process the Lemon Quality Dataset provided in the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yusufemir/lemon-quality-dataset).

**AlexNet** 

**Next,** I will employ the **AlexNet** architecture, a popular deep learning model known for its pioneering role in the ImageNet challenge. AlexNet's deeper layers and larger capacity will enable it to capture more complex features and improve the segmentation performance on the Lemon Quality Dataset.

**VGG16**

**Lastly,** I will utilize the **VGG16** (Visual Geometry Group) architecture, which have deeper and complex structures. These models are renowned for their exceptional performance on various image recognition tasks. By leveraging the pre-trained weights of VGG, I can benefit from the learned features and fine-tune the network for image segmentation on the Lemon Quality Dataset.



**Throughout the project,** 

I will preprocess the dataset by resizing the images and splitting it into training and testing sets. For training, I will employ a loss function suitable for image segmentation, such as the Dice coefficient or cross-entropy loss, and optimize the models using techniques like stochastic gradient descent, rms prop or Adam optimization.

**After training the models,**

I will evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics. Additionally, I will visualize the segmentation results to gain insights into how well the models can accurately identify and classify different regions within the lemon images.

This project will contribute to advancing the understanding and application of deep learning in the field of computer vision and could potentially find applications in quality assessment and sorting of lemons.
