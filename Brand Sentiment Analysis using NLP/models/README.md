*Brand Sentiment Analysis using NLP*<br>
*🎯 Goal*<br>
The main goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on brand-related text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The purpose is to understand the sentiment expressed in textual content related to a brand, which can be valuable for businesses to gauge public opinion and improve their brand perception.<br>

*🧵 Dataset*<br>
The dataset used in this project is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tusharpaul2001/brand-sentiment-analysis-dataset . It comprises user-generated reviews and sentiments related to various brands. The dataset includes columns such as 'Brand', 'Category', 'Tweet', and 'Sentiment', providing a diverse set of textual data for sentiment analysis.<br>
<br>

*🧾 Description*<br>
This project utilizes LSTM and BERT models for brand sentiment analysis. The LSTM model captures sequential patterns in the text, while the BERT model leverages contextual embeddings for more accurate sentiment analysis.<br>
<br>
