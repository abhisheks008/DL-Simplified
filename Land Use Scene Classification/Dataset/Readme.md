# Context
The main aim of this project is the masking of regions where land is being used in satellite images obtained through Landsat which have a low spatial resolution.

# Content
This dataset contains satellite images of 21 classes such as buildings, baseball fields, freeways, etc. The original size of the images is 256x256 pixels. Originally there were 100 images per class. After augmenting each image 4 times the size of each class was brought up to 500 images. This allows for making
a more robust model.
