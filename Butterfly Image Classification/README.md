# **Butterfly Image Classification**

## 🎯 Goal
The primary goal of this project is to build and compare various deep learning models to accurately classify butterfly images into their respective species.

## 🧵 Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phucthaiv02/butterfly-image-classification

## 🧾 Description
This dataset consists of over 1000 labeled images of butterflies, including validation images. Each image belongs to only one butterfly category. The challenge is to develop models that can accurately classify these images into the correct species.

## 🚀 Models Implemented
1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. EfficientNet
3. ResNet50

## 📚 Libraries Needed
- TensorFlow: For building and training deep learning models.
- Keras: For simplifying the creation and training of neural networks.
- NumPy: For numerical computations and array operations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing data.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Results
The dataset features 75 different classes of Butterflies. The dataset contains about 1000+ labelled images including the validation images. Each image belongs to only one butterfly category.
